DESCRIPTION 

In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make analysis easier.

HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN PROJECT:

I made use the following Python libraries:

* pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* csv

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. Here are the installation steps:

Download the installer from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Choose the Python 3.6 or higher version, and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer.

USE OF PROJECT:

In this project, I walk through the data analysis process and make sense of how everything - The Data Analysis Process - fits together. You'll learn to apply structured thinking approach to find solutions to any data analysis problem posed.
